# Coin-Counter

## This website is designed to " takes X amount of money (such as \$4.99) and determines the exact amount of change needed in quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies." as per instructed in the project specs

**What should happen**

1. The app should take a dollar amount from the user.
2. A recursive function should have a condition for each coin (pennies, quarters, nickels, dimes) that returns the amount of coins in the total
3. A template literal should display the objects as a key-pair value.
